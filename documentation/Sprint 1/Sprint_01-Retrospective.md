# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Stories Done for sprint 1
### 1. WebCrawler (5-SP):
As a developer, I need to create a web crawler to extract website routes for extracting data. I should create an extraction engine that can extract data from coingeko.com and then store the data in the SQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure.
### 2. Add recurrent layers for memorising information (3-SP):
As a developer, I need to use the sequential model to process data from the database.
### 3. Creating a sequential model (3-SP):
As a developer, Add activation functions to the dense layers for the accuracy of the Neural Network to be improved.
### 4. Documentation-Sprint01 (1-SP):
As a developer, I need to document a report for the first sprint.
### 5. Setup database (1-SP):
As a developer, I should create a database that will store all tables relating to the project.

### sprint velocity:
velocity = StoriesDoneSp - storiesLeftSp
         =  13-0
= 13

## Retrospect
### challenges:
* Communication was poor at the beginning and towards the end of the sprint 
* unplanned Load-shedding
* Not keeping up with time

### Challenges mitigation plan
* Members should meet regularly and report on their progress.
* Work on campus during load-shedding hours.
* Members should work consistently and regularly push their branches on github to show their progress.

### Things to continue doing:
* Plan and write the documentation for each sprint together.
* Continue assiting each other when there are challenges.
